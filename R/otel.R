#' `r lifecycle::badge("experimental")` OpenTelemetry integration
#'
#' @description
#' \pkg{otel} provides tools for integrating with OpenTelemetry, a framework for
#' observability and tracing in distributed systems.
#'
#' These methods are intended to enhance the framework to be used with the
#' \pkg{promises} package, not as a generic replacement.
#'
#' Developer note - Barret 2025/09: This ospan handoff promise domain topic is
#' complex and has been discussed over many hours. Many advanced Shiny/R
#' developers are not even aware of promise domains (very reasonable!),
#' therefore this topic requires more in-depth documentation and examples.
#'
#' @section Definitions:
#'
#' * Promise domain: An environment in which has setup/teardown methods. These
#'   environments can be composed together to facilitate execution context for
#'   promises. In normal R execution, this can be achieved with scope / stack.
#'   But for complex situations, such as the currently open graphics device,
#'   async operations require promise domains to setup/teardown these contexts
#'   to function properly. Otherwise a multi-stage promise that adds to the
#'   graphics device at each stage will only ever print to the most recently
#'   created graphics device, not the associated graphics device. These promise
#'   domains are not automatically created, they must be manually added to the
#'   execution stack, for example `with_ospan_promise_domain()` does this for
#'   OpenTelemetry spans ("ospan").
#' * Promise domain restoration: When switching from one promise chain to
#'   another, the execution context is torn down and then re-established. This
#'   re-establishment is called "promise domain restoration". During this
#'   process, the promise domains are restored in their previously established
#'   combination order.
#' * Promise chain: A set of promise objects to execute over multiple async
#'   ticks.
#' * Async tick: the number of times an event loop must run to move computation
#'   forward. (Similar to a JavaScript event loop tick.)
#' * `then()` promise domain capture: When `then()` is called, it will capture
#'   the current promise domain. This promise domain is restored (only if
#'   needed) when evaluating the given `onFulfilled` and `onRejected` callbacks.
#'   This captured promise domain does not go into any downstream promise chain
#'   objects. The only way the promise domain is captured is exactly when the
#'   `then()` method is called.
#'
#' `with_ospan_promise_domain()` creates a promise domain that restores the
#' currently active OpenTelemetry span from when a call to `promises::then()` is
#' executed. Given the special circumstance where only the current ospan is
#' needed to continue recording (not a full ancestry tree of ospans), we can
#' capture _just_ the current ospan and reactivate that ospan during promise
#' domain restoration.
#'
#' @section When promise domains are captured:
#'
#' Asynchronous operation
#' * Creates `async_op` ospan
#' * Automatically ends the ospan (`async_op`) when the promise (p)
#'   resolves or rejects
#'
#' The code below illustrates an example of when the promise domain are
#' created/captured/restored and when ospan objects are
#' created/activated/reactivated/ended.
#'
#' ```r
#' # t0.0
#' p2 <- with_ospan_promise_domain({
#'   # t0.1
#'   p <- with_ospan_async("async_op", {
#'     # ... return a promise ...
#'     init_async_work() |> # t0.2
#'       then( # t0.3
#'         some_async_work # t1.0
#'       )
#'   }) # t0.4, t1.0, t2.0
#'   p |>
#'     then( # t0.5
#'       more_async_work # t3.0
#'     )
#' }) # t0.6
#'
#' p_final <-
#'   p2 |> then( # t0.7
#'     final_work # t4.0
#'   )
#' ```
#'
#' An in-depth explanation of the execution timeline is below.
#' * At the first initial tick, `t0.*`:
#'   * `t0.0`: The code is wrapped in `with_ospan_promise_domain()`
#'   * `t0.1`: The `async_op` ospan is created and activated
#'   * `t0.2`: Some async work is initiated
#'   * `t0.3`: `then()` is called, capturing the active `async_op` ospan (as it
#'     is called within `with_ospan_promise_domain()`)
#'   * `t0.4`: The `with_ospan_async()` call exits, but the `async_op` ospan is
#'     not ended as the promise is still pending. The returned promise has a
#'     `finally()` step added to it that will end the ospan `async_op` when `p`
#'     is resolved.
#'   * `t0.5`: Another `then()` is called, but there is no active ospan to
#'     capture
#'   * `t0.6`: The ospan promise domain call exits
#'   * `t0.7`: Another `then()` is called. No ospan will be captured as there is
#'     no active ospan / promise domain
#' * At the first followup tick, `t1.0`:
#'   * The active `async_op` ospan is reactivated during promise domain
#'     restoration for the duration of the `then` callback
#'   * The `some_async_work` function is called
#' * At tick, `t2.0`:
#'   * `some_async_work` has resolved
#'   * A hidden `finally()` step closes the ospan, `async_op`
#'   * `p` is now resolved
#' * At tick, `t3.0`:
#'   * There is no active ospan at `t0.5`, so no ospan is reactivated during
#'     promise domain restoration
#'   * The `more_async_work` function is executed
#' * At tick, `t4.0`:
#'   * `more_async_work` has resolved, therefore `p2` is now resolved
#'   * There was no ospan promise domain at `t0.7`, so no attempt is made to
#'     reactivate any ospan
#'   * The `final_work` function is executed
#' * At tick, `t5.0`:
#'   * `p_final` has resolved

#'
#' @section Complexity:
#'
#' When reactivating the `k`th step in a promise chain, the currently active
#' ospan (during the call to `then()`) will be reactivated during promise domain
#' restoration (`O(1)`). To restore a chain of promises, the active ospan will
#' be restored at each step (`O(n)`) due to the **`n`** calls to wrapping each
#' `onFulfilled` and `onRejected` callbacks inside `then()`.
#'
#' If we did NOT have a handoff promise domain for ospan restoration, a regular
#' promise domain approach would be needed at each step to restore the active
#' ospan. Each step would call `with_active_span()` `k` times (`O(k)`, where as
#' handoff domain computes in `O(1)`). Taking a step back, to restore each ospan
#' at for every step in a promise chain would then take `O(n^2)` time, not
#' `O(n)`. The standard, naive promise domain approach does not scale for
#' multiple similar promise domain restorations.
#'
#'
#' @section Execution model for `with_ospan_promise_domain()`:
#'
#' 1. `with_ospan_promise_domain(expr)` is called.
#'    * The following steps all occur within `expr`.
#' 2. Create an ospan object using `otel::start_span()`.
#'    * We need the ospan to be active during the a followup async operation.
#'      Therefore, `otel::start_local_active_span()` is not appropriate as the
#'      ospan would be ended when the function exits, not when the promise chain
#'      resolves.
#' 2. Be sure your ospan is activated before calling `promises::then()`.
#'    * Activate it using `with_ospan_async(name, expr)` (which also
#'      creates/ends the ospan) or `otel::with_active_span(span, expr)`.
#' 3. Call `promises::then()`
#'   * When `promises::then()` is called, the two methods (`onFulfilled` and
#'     `onRejected`) capture the currently active spans. (Performed by the
#'     initial `with_ospan_promise_domain()`)
#' 4. During reactivation of the promise chain step, the previously captured
#'    ospan is reactivated via `with_active_span()`. (Performed by the initial
#'    `with_ospan_promise_domain()`)
#'
#' @section OpenTelemetry span compatibility:
#'
#' For ospan objects to exist over may async ticks, the ospan must be created
#' using `otel::start_span()` and later ended using `otel::end_span()`. Ending
#' the ospan must occur **after** any promise chain work has completed.
#'
#' If we were to instead use `otel::start_local_active_span()`, the ospan would
#' be ended when the function exits, not when the promise chain completes. Even
#' though the local ospan is created, activated, and eventually ended, the ospan
#' will not exist during reactivation of the ospan promise domain.
#'
#' `with_ospan_async()` is a convenience method that creates, activates, and
#' ends the ospan only after the returned promise (if any) resolves. It also
#' properly handles both synchronous (ending the ospan within `on.exit()`) and
#' asynchronous operations (ending the ospan within `promises::finally()`).
#'
#'
#'
#'
#' @describeIn otel `r lifecycle::badge("experimental")`
#'
#' Creates an OpenTelemetry span, executes the given expression within it, and
#' ends the span.
#'
#' This method **requires** the use of `with_ospan_promise_domain()`

#'
#' This function is designed to handle both synchronous and asynchronous
#' (promise-based) operations. For promises, the span is automatically ended
#' when the promise resolves or rejects.

#' span will be automatically ended when the promise completes.
#'
#' This function differs from synchronous otel span operations in that it

#' addition, the internal span will be ended either when the function exits (for
#' synchronous operations) or when a returned promise completes (for
#' asynchronous operations).

#' Adds an idempotent handoff Active OpenTelemetry span promise domain.
#'
#' Package authors are required to use this function to have otel span context
#' persist across asynchronous boundaries. This method is only needed once per
#' promise domain stack. If you are unsure, feel free to call
#' `with_ospan_promise_domain()` as the underlying promise domain will only be
#' added if not found within the current promise domain stack. If your package
#' **only** works within Shiny apps, Shiny will have already added the domain so
#' no need to add it yourself. If your package works outside of Shiny and you
#' use `{promises}` (i.e. `{chromote}`), then you'll need to use this wrapper
#' method.
#'
#' This method adds a _handoff_ Active OpenTelemetry span promise domain to the
#' expression evaluation. This _handoff_ promise domain will only run once on
#' reactivation. This is critical if there are many layered `with_ospan_async()`
#' calls, such as within Shiny reactivity. For example, if we nested many
#' `with_ospan_async()` of which each added a promise domain that reactivated
#' each ospan on restore, we'd reactivate `k` ospan objects (`O(k)`) when we
